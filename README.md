# The Dot Game
This app is an adaptation of the Dot Game exercise from the Montessori classroom. The Dot Game is a mathematical exercise that introduces addition in a more abstract way without counting concrete objects. It is a visual aid that helps develop an understanding of the decimal system. The user will work through equations of large sums using the tools in the app to visualize the symbolic representation of large numbers. The idea for this app is inspired by my love of the Montessori teaching method. Some underlying goals of this app are to foster intrinsic motivation, self-correction, and to build self-confidence in the user. The target age-group is students aged 5-6.

#Features
* User login: Users can create accounts and log in to the application. Users can keep track of their solved equations. 
* The Dot Game: The Dot Game is the main feature of the app. The user solves an equation involving the addition of two addends by systematically filling out a grid with a column representing each unit in the decimal system (beginning with ones and moving on to tens, hundreds, and thousands). The user can check to see if their answer is correct and choose to save the equation.
* Demonstration: The user can view a video with a step-by-step solution to a sample equation in the Dot Game.
* Printable books: Users can print a collection of their solved equations that they can cut out and assemble into a book. This is a common activity in a Montessori classroom.

#Technologies
* Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, Thymeleaf templates
